# AGENTS.md

Shared instructions for every coding agent in this repository. `CLAUDE.md` imports this file (`@AGENTS.md`); do not duplicate rules there. The personal working contract in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` still applies on top.

<!-- BOOTSTRAP_ONLY_START -->
## New repository: run /intake first

`docs/PROJECT.md` is still the template. Run `/intake` before any `/task`, `/plan` or code; it fills the project facts and deletes this section with its markers. `scripts/project_check.py` fails while the intake is completed and this block is still here.
<!-- BOOTSTRAP_ONLY_END -->

## Source of truth

- `docs/PROJECT.md` owns scope, the capability ledger, decisions the agent makes alone, the unattended policy and the gate checks. Read it first. A capability with no ledger row is `absent`; dormant code or an old doc is not a requirement.
- `docs/plans/<slug>.md` owns the current task list. Work from it; update it; never delete tasks.
- Runbooks in `docs/` own setup and operations. Verify against code, scripts and runtime output rather than trusting a stale doc; update the doc when behavior, contracts, setup or operations change.

## Map

Read the owning guide before changing an area; read only the sections you need. `/intake` fills this table.

## Engineering

- Fix the owning cause, not a symptom in a caller. A cross-layer bug may have a one-file fix; verify affected callers.
- Smallest coherent change with clear ownership. Small duplication beats the wrong shared abstraction. Remove workarounds when their cause is fixed.
- Match investigation to the change: contracts need producer, consumer, serializer and read/write checks; auth and routing need enforcement, guards and state; async work needs retries, idempotency, ordering, cancellation and failure visibility.
- Architecture rules live in checks, not prose: put layering and import boundaries into a check that exits non-zero and reports `path:line [rule] message` — the tool the project already uses for it (an import contract, a dependency linter, a module-boundary rule of the build), or a short script — and list it under gate checks.
- Reproducible bug → failing regression test first, then the fix, then the original reproduction again.
- A behaviour change carries its test, and that test was seen failing before the change. Coverage may not fall: the floor in `.coverage-gate.json` rises by itself and is lowered only as a recorded decision. A check that has never been red does not count — break the code in a scratch copy once and keep the red output.

## Validation

- A check passes only when the behavior is correct and the command exits 0. Report failed or unavailable checks plainly; a task with broken primary behavior is not done.
- Run the baseline once before the first edit to separate pre-existing failures from new ones; record it in the plan's `## Log`.
- Narrowest stable check per change; the full gate list before a task is marked `[x]`; broad regression only for cross-cutting changes or release.
- End-to-end tests only for the minimal product-critical path; assert outcomes (persisted data, navigation), never wording or layout.
- Tests that use an external stateful resource (a database, a queue, a bucket):
  - a shared "world" built once is reached by read-only tests through a read-only connection (PostgreSQL: `SET default_transaction_read_only = on`, or a role with `SELECT` only), so a test that starts writing fails at once instead of poisoning the tests after it;
  - a fast world builder that bypasses the product's service layer (one SQL function, a bulk `INSERT … RETURNING`) has an equivalence test in the full tier: the world built both ways, table snapshots compared; at least one test per entity still goes through the service layer;
  - a resource named after a process (`test_<pid>_…`) has a sweeper that drops the ones whose process is gone, and the full tier declares a `leftover=` count for it;
  - parallel workers each get their own resource, and the distribution keeps a module on one worker when the resource is per module (pytest-xdist: `--dist loadfile` or `loadscope`, not `load`);
  - fewer calls per test before more workers: build what read-only tests share once, batch independent calls; the number of workers comes from measured peak memory, not from the number of cores.

## Git and workspace

- Inspect `git status --short --branch` and `git remote -v` before any git operation. Work on the branch the plan names; never switch mid-run. Stage by path, never `git add -A` (submodule pointers, marker files).
- Never `git stash`, `reset --hard`, `clean`, or `checkout -- .` to make progress. If uncommitted user changes block you, stop that task with `[!] BLOCKED` and continue with others.
- Commit per finished task when `docs/PROJECT.md` says so; message `T##: <what changed>`. Never push unless asked.
- Scratch goes to `.claude/scratch/`, never the repo root. Remove your own scratch when done.
- Never stop or kill processes to free a port; use another port.
- Parallel copies of this repository (worktrees of parallel workers, a night run beside a day session) share nothing mutable. Derive every local resource from the copy's path: ports, Compose project names, test database names, temporary directories, local buckets. A test database name ends in `_test` and a test refuses to run against any other; tearing down a database another copy may be using is never done.
- Secrets, tokens, cookies, customer data and raw `.env` values never appear in logs, tests, fixtures or replies. Never weaken auth, validation, rate limits or auditability to pass a check.
- Generated files change through their generator (schema → migration), never by hand.

## Reporting

- What changed, why, which checks ran with their results, remaining risk or blocked items, suggested commit message. No headings for their own sake, no restating the task.
